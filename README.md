# Web_dev
This repository consists of some of the Programs which have been coded for practicing web development exercises:

(EX1) The document must have a paragraph of text that describes your home. Choose at least three different phrases (3 to 6 words) of this paragraph and make them change font, font style, color and font size when the mouse cursor is placed over them. Each of the different phrases must change to different fonts, font styles, colors and font sizes.

(EX2) The document must contain four short paragraphs of text stacked on top of each other with only enough of each showing so that the mouse cursor can also be placed over some part of them. When the cursor is placed over the exposed part of any paragraph it should raise to the top to become completely visible.

(EX3) Design an XML document to store information about patience in a hospital. Information about patients must include name (in 3 parts, first name, middle name, last name), social security number (SSN), age, room number, primary insurance company – including member identification number, group number and address – secondary insurance company (in the same sub parts as for the primary insurance company), known medical problems, and known drug allergies. Both attributes and nested tags must be included. Make up sample data of at least 4 patients. Create a CSS style sheet for the above XML document and use it to create a display of that document.

(EX4) Create the XSLT style sheet to format all the patient elements of the XML, document of exercise 3 and use it to create a display of whole element.

(EX5) Write an XHTML document to include an anchor tag, that calls a PHP document also write the called PHP document which returns a randomly chosen greeting from a list of five different greetings. The greetings must be stored as constant strings in the script. A random number between 0 and 4 can be computed with these line.
           #set the seed for mtrand with the number of microseconds 
               #since the last full second of the clock mt_strand((double) microtime() * 1000000);              
               $number=mtrand(0,4);
               #computes a random integer 0-4 
Write the PHP script for above to count the number of visitors and display that number for each visitor.
Hint: Use a file to store current count.

(EX6) Write the XHTML code using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to create the form with the following   capabilities
 	a) A text widget to collect the users name
 	b) Four check boxes, one each for the following items
 	     i) Four 100 watt light bulbs for Rs. 20=39
 	    ii) Eight 100 watt light bulbs for Rs 40=20
  	    iii) Four 100 watt long life light bulbs for Rs. 30=95
 	    iv) Eight 100 watt long life light bulbs for Rs 70=49
            c) A collection of 3 radio buttons that are labeled as follows
   	    i) Visa
  	    ii) Master Card
 	    iii) Discover
Write a PHP script that computes the total cost of the ordered light bulbs for the above program after adding 13.5% VAT. The program must inform the buyer of exactly what was ordered in table.

(EX7) Write a XHTML code to provide a form that collects names and telephone numbers. The phone numbers must be in the format ddd-ddd-dddd. Write a PHP script that checks the submitted telephone number to be sure that it confirms to the required format and then returns a response that indicates whether the number was correct.

(EX8) Write the XHTML code using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to accept from the user name, phone no, mail-id, stored in database. Retrieve same information from database using a separate PHP script.

(EX9) Write a servlet that returns a randomly chosen greeting from a list of five different greetings. The greeting must be stored as constant strings in the program.
