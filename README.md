This repository consists of some of the Programs which have been coded for practicing web development exercises:

<EX1> The document must have a paragraph of text that describes your home. Choose at least three different phrases (3 to 6 words) of this paragraph and make them change font, font style, color and font size when the mouse cursor is placed over them. Each of the different phrases must change to different fonts, font styles, colors and font sizes.

<EX2> The document must contain four short paragraphs of text stacked on top of each other with only enough of each showing so that the mouse cursor can also be placed over some part of them. When the cursor is placed over the exposed part of any paragraph it should raise to the top to become completely visible.

<EX3>
